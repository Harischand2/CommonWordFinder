# CommonWordFinder
The goal of this project is to use three of the data structures ( BSTMap, AVLTreeMap, and
MyHashMap) to create a program that finds the ùëõ most common words 
(with the help of a sorting algorithm such as merge sort)  in a document. BSTMap,
AVLTreeMap, and MyHashMap implements the MyMap interface. So, with proper object-oriented
programming technique, specifically the use of polymorphism, one can create any one of
these data structures and refer to it from a MyMap reference. Though all three classes
implement the same interface, their methods are implemented very differently, leading to
different execution times on the computer.
